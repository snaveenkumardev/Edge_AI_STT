 * Decides *whether* an utterance is an emergency. Nothing downstream re-litigates that call.
 *
 * Three detectors, in order, each short-circuiting the next:
 *
 * 1. **Phrase trigger** — the user deliberately repeating the safe word.
 * 2. **Explicit plea** — the person actually says "help". Deterministic.
 * 3. **Classifier LLM** — a general instruction-tuned Gemma, asked a yes/no question about
 *    whether this is an emergency, then a second question for the category.
 *
 * The plea check is *not* the return of the general keyword scan that was removed. That one
 * guessed at emergencies from words like "fell" and "dizzy", matched "that was really helpful",
 * and found nothing the model had not already found. This matches only utterances that **are**
 * a call for help — the one thing a monitoring device must never miss, and the one thing the
 * classifier measurably fails at: asked about a bare `"Help"`, it answered NO.
 *
 * That failure is structural rather than a tuning accident. The yes/no prompt tells the model
 * to answer NO to fragments and greetings, and a single word with no context reads as exactly
 * that. Widening the prompt to catch it swung the model to answering YES to everything —
 * measured, twice. So the plea stays in code, where it is deterministic and testable.
 *
 * Beyond that, **the classifier is the only judge of unprompted speech**. If its model is not
 * loaded, the safe word and the plea check are all that remain — see [isClassifierReady].
