 *   with the method signatures [com.example.sentriai.model_inference.speech_to_text.WhisperModel]
 *   expects, so these are local exports and bundling is the only route that needs no hosting.
 * - **Gemma downloads.** Both bundles are far too large to add to the APK on top of Whisper.
 *
 * Sizes and digests describe the files this app was developed against. They are only enforced
 * on a *download*; a bundled asset is trusted. Re-export Whisper or re-convert a Gemma bundle
 * and these must be updated too.
